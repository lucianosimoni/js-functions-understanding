# What is a function?
### In a simple way: A block of code that can be called and may return a value after the call.

# How function arguments work?
### They are the main thing in a function (even though it could use other values). Could be the input in which the function will work to return the desired value. They are good

# How return statements work?
### They are called within the function code block. Usually at the end of such block, but could also be used among other conditions to end when you want it returning what you want. They stop the function and return a single value.
